# ThoughtWorks interview Experience:
 
**Pair Coding**:
   They expect us solve the question with OOPS concept with the ability to dynamically add new doctors and appointments.

*As this is a pairing round you could ask any doubt at any point to them.*

**Tech HR 1:**
- This one is based on DSA, DB (these 2 things are expected in all my interviews)
- A simple star pattern to code and i was asked to iterate all over it.
- Number of Island Problems: (i was asked the same in Deshaw)
- A 2D matrix having zeros and ones, we want to find the groups of 2 in the matrix.(if two one is adjacent then they are in the same group)
- Then talked about Html and css as i have mentioned on my intro 
- Then came the twist: they asked me to design a data structure to implement css (nested)selector properties to the HTML dom. The long Convo ended up with using Trees.
- Then coming to DB I said I would prefer Mongo and we had some convo over the reasons why I choosed Mongo rather than Mysql
- Then they insisted me to learn some advantages of mysql over Mongo too.
- Typical Queries on mysql to use join function. (think on using which type of join you are using)

**Tech HR 2:**
- This one is purely on me, the things i have mentioned on my resume.
- As I have updated some recent projects, i had question over it (advantages, disadvantages, future improvements about it)
- Do mention what you have done do far in your resume, it would be helpful here.

**General HR:**
- The company is little different.so we had talked about social issues and they want to know how i am rather than curriculum and my leadership qualities...

*if you face a question that you don't know do update your knowledge on that even after that interview.*

*Ask as many question you think of in front of the HR to get the most clarity.*
